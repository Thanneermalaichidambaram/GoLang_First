# Go Web Server Example

This is a simple example of a Go web server that serves static files, handles form submissions, and responds to HTTP requests.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

- The server serves static files from the `static` directory. Place your static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) in this directory.
- Access the server at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- The server has two endpoints:
  - `/form`: Handles form submissions. Submit a form with `name` and `address` fields.
  - `/hello`: Responds with "hello!" to HTTP GET requests.
